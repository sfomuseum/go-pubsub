# go-pubsub

Go package to provide a common interface for abstract publish and subscribe operations.

## Important

Ideally this package would/could be replaced by the [GoCloud pubsub package](https://gocloud.dev/howto/pubsub/) but it does not support Redis.

## Documentation

Documentation is incomplete at this time.
